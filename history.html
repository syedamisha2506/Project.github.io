        <p>
          The Nobel Prizes were established by the will of <span class="highlight">Alfred Nobel</span>, a Swedish <strong>chemist, engineer,
          inventor</strong>, and <strong>philanthropist</strong> best known for inventing dynamite. <strong>Born in 1833</strong>, Alfred Nobel was a man of
          <strong>science</strong>
          and <strong>innovation</strong> who held over 350 patents during his lifetime.
          <br><br>
          In <strong>1895</strong>, a year before his death, Nobel signed his final will at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris. In this
          document, he left the majority of his fortune — roughly 31 million Swedish kronor (over $250 million today) —
          to
          create a series of prizes for those who <span class="highlight">“conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”</span>
          <br><br>
          After his death in <strong>1896</strong>, the will caused considerable debate among his relatives and the public. However, the
          <span class="highlight">Nobel Foundation</span> was formally established in <strong>1900</strong> to fulfill his vision, and the first Nobel Prizes were
          awarded
          in <strong>1901</strong>.
