        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2024 was awarded jointly to Daron
          Acemoglu, Simon Henry Roberts Johnson and James A. Robinson "for studies of how institutions are formed and
          affect prosperity"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          There are vast differences in prosperity between nations. One important explanation for this is persistent
          differences in societal institutions. By examining the various political and economic systems introduced by
          European colonisers, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson have been able to demonstrate a
          relationship between institutions and prosperity. They have also developed theoretical tools that can explain
          why differences in institutions persist and how institutions can change.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2023 was awarded to Claudia Goldin
          "for having advanced our understanding of women’s labour market outcomes"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Women are vastly underrepresented in the global labour market and, when they work, they earn less than men.
          Claudia Goldin has demonstrated how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates have changed
          over time in the United States. The participation of married women decreased with the transition from an
          agrarian to an industrial society in the 19th century, but increased with the growth of the service sector in
          the 20th century. Goldin explained this pattern as the result of structural change and evolving social norms
          regarding women’s responsibilities for home and family.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 was awarded jointly to Ben S.
          Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig "for research on banks and financial crises"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          What is the role of banks in the economy and society? What happens if they collapse?
          The foundations of modern banking research were laid by Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig in the
          early 1980s. Through statistical analysis and historical source research, Bernanke demonstrated how failing
          banks played a decisive role in the global depression of the 1930s. Bernanke’s research shows that bank crises
          can potentially have catastrophic consequences. This insight illustrates the importance of well-functioning
          bank regulation.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2021 was divided, one half awarded
          to David Card "for his empirical contributions to labour economics", the other half jointly to Joshua D.
          Angrist and Guido W. Imbens "for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Many of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. Some of these questions are
          possible to answer using natural experiments, in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of
          people being treated differently. In 1994, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens showed what conclusions about
          causation can be drawn from natural experiments in which people cannot be either forced or forbidden to
          participate in the programme being studied.

          The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2020 was awarded jointly to Paul R.
          Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson "for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Humans have been selling things to the highest bidder or buying things from the cheapest source for thousands
          of years. These days, goods and services change hands for astronomical values at auctions daily. Paul Milgrom
          and Robert Wilson have studied how auctions work. They have also translated their theories into practice and
          created new auctions for goods and services that are difficult to sell through traditional means, such as
          radio frequencies. Their discoveries have benefited sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world.
