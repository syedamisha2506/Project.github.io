                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Nobel Peace Prize 2024 was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo "for its efforts to achieve a world free of
                    nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be
                    used again"
                </p>
                <h2>Work </h2>
                <p>
                    The two American atomic bombs that were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 killed
                    approximately 120 000 people. A comparable number died later of burn and radiation injuries. It is
                    estimated that 650 000 people survived the attacks. These survivors are known as Hibakusha in
                    Japanese.

                    The fate of the survivors was long concealed and ignored. In 1956, local Hibakusha associations
                    along with victims of nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific formed The Japan Confederation of A- and
                    H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations, shortened in Japanese to Nihon Hidankyo. This grassroots movement
                    soon became the largest and most widely representative Hibakusha organisation in Japan.

                    Nihon Hidankyo has two main objectives. The first is to promote the social and economic rights of
                    all Hibakusha, including those living outside Japan. The second is to ensure that no one ever again
                    is subjected to the catastrophe that befell the Hibakusha.

                    Through personal witness statements, Nihon Hidankyo has carried out extensive educational work on
                    the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. Hence the motto “No more
                    Hibakusha”.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Nobel Peace Prize 2023 was awarded to Narges Mohammadi "for her fight against the oppression of
                    women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all"
                </p>
                <h2>Work </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nobel Peace Prize for 2023 was awarded to the imprisoned Iranian human rights advocate Narges
                    Mohammadi. More than 20 years of fighting for women’s rights made her a symbol of freedom and
                    standard-bearer in the struggle against the Iranian theocracy. In 2003, she joined the Defenders of
                    Human Rights Center, founded by that year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Shirin Ebadi. In the years
                    that followed, Ms Mohammadi helped imprisoned activists, led a campaign against the death penalty
                    and criticized the regime’s use of torture and sexualized violence.

                    The freedom struggle cost her dearly. She was arrested 13 times and sentenced to 31 years in prison
                    and 154 lashes. In October 2023, when her selection as the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was announced,
                    she was locked in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison.

                <p>
                    The 2022 Peace Prize is awarded to human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski from Belarus, the Russian
                    human rights organisation Memorial and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil

                <p>
                    Ales Bialiatski has worked to promote democracy and human rights in Belarus since the 1980s. He has
                    been called a beacon of light for these efforts throughout Eastern Europe.As a result of Ales
                    Bialiatski’s work, the government authorities sought to silence him. In 2011, they sentenced him to
                    several years’ imprisonment for alleged tax evasion. He was released in 2014. In June 2021, in the
                    wake of the massive demonstrations against President Lukashenko’s dictatorship that broke out after
                    the presidential election in August 2020, Ales Bialiatski was again jailed, this time without trial
                    or conviction. He was still in prison when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Nobel Peace Prize 2021 was awarded jointly to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Andreyevich Muratov "for
                    their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting
                    peace"
                </p>
                <h2>Work </h2>
                <p>
                    Dmitry Muratov started out as a journalist for Soviet newspapers. After the dissolution of the
                    Soviet Union in 1991, he and other journalists co-founded the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which soon
                    became a leading advocate for democracy and freedom of expression in Russia. The Soviet Union’s last
                    leader and the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Mikhail Gorbachev, supported the newspaper
                    financially and became co-owner in 2006. Mr Muratov has been editor-in-chief for most years since
                    1995. <br>
                    In 2012, she was one of the co-founders of the Rappler online news site. As an investigative
                    journalist, she has distinguished herself as a fearless defender of freedom of expression and has
                    exposed the abuse of power, use of violence and increasing authoritarianism of the regime of
                    President Rodrigo Duterte. In particular, Ms Ressa has focused critical attention on President
                    Duterte’s controversial, murderous anti-drug campaign. She and Rappler have also documented how
                    social media are being used to spread fake news, harass opponents and manipulate public discourse.

                <p>
                    The Nobel Peace Prize 2020 was awarded to World Food Programme (WFP) "for its efforts to combat
                    hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for
                    acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict"

                <p>
                    The World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger, promote
                    peace in conflict-affected areas, and prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.WFP
                    works in particular to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating
                    poverty and hunger. In 2019, more than 100 million people suffered from severe hunger, most of them
                    as a result of war and conflict. The worldwide Corona pandemic did also swell the number of poor and
                    hungry. In 2019, WFP provided emergency food assistance in 88 countries, but the organisation also
                    worked in a long-term perspective to increase local production of food and to meet the nutritional
                    needs of women and infants.
