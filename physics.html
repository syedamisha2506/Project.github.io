      The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 119 times to 230 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2025. John
      Bardeen is the only laureate who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, in 1956 and 1972. This means
      that a total of 229 individuals have received the Nobel Prize in Physics. Click on the links to get more

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 was awarded jointly to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton "for foundational
          discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          When we talk about artificial intelligence, we often mean machine learning using artificial neural networks.
          This technology was originally inspired by the structure of the brain. In an artificial neural network, the
          brain’s neurons are represented by nodes that have different values. In 1982, John Hopfield invented a network
          that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns. He found inspiration in physics' models of how many
          small parts in a system affect the system as a whole. The invention became important in, for example, image
          analysis.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
         The Nobel Prize in Physics 2023 was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz "for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
         Electronic motions initiate processes that create and maintain life, and are behind the exchange of energy between light and matter. These are arguably the most important motions for human life, evolving in hundreds of attoseconds. Attosecond pulses allow us to capture them inside atoms, molecules and solids. In 2001, Pierre Agostini succeeded in producing and investigating a series of consecutive light pulses, in which each pulse lasted just 250 attoseconds. Potential applications of attosecond pulses include in electronics and medical diagnostics.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
       The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded jointly to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger "for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
        One of the most remarkable traits of quantum mechanics is that it allows two or more particles to exist in what is called an entangled state. What happens to one of the particles in an entangled pair determines what happens to the other particle, even if they are far apart. In 1981–1982, Alain Aspect conducted groundbreaking experiments using entangled light particles, photons. These and other experiments confirm that quantum mechanics is correct and pave the way for quantum computers, quantum networks and quantum encrypted communication.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
       The Nobel Prize in Physics 2021 was awarded "for groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of complex physical systems" with one half jointly to Syukuro Manabe and "for the physical modelling of Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming" and the other half to Giorgio Parisi "for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
        Our world is full of complex systems characterised by randomness and disorder. One complex system of vital importance to humankind is Earth’s climate. Syukuro Manabe demonstrated how increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere lead to increased temperatures at the surface of the Earth. In the 1960s, he led the development of physical models of the Earth’s climate and was the first person to explore the interaction between radiation balance and the vertical transport of air masses. His work laid the foundation for the development of current climate models.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
       The Nobel Prize in Physics 2020 was divided, one half awarded to Roger Penrose "for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity", the other half jointly to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez "for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
        A black hole is a supermassive compact object with a gravitational force so large that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. In 1964, Roger Penrose proposed critical mathematical tools to describe black holes. He showed that Einstein’s general theory of relativity means the formation of black holes must be seen as a natural process in the development of the universe. He was also able to describe black holes in detail: at their farthest depths is a singularity where all known laws of nature dissolve.
