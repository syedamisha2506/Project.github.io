      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Nobel Prize in Literature 2024 was awarded to Han Kang "for her intense poetic prose that confronts
        historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life"
      </p>
      <h2>Work </h2>
      <p>
        Han Kang began her career in 1993 as a poet, but has since written mainly novels and short stories. In her
        oeuvre, she confronts historical traumas and invisible sets of rules and, in each of her works, exposes the
        fragility of human life. She has a unique awareness of the connections between body and soul, the living and
        the dead, and in her poetic and experimental style has become an innovator in contemporary prose. Among her
        works are The Vegetarian, Human Acts and We Do Not Part.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Nobel Prize in Literature 2023 was awarded to Jon Fosse, "for his innovative plays and prose which give
        voice to the unsayable"
      </p>
      <h2>Work </h2>
      <p>
        Jon Fosse's immense œuvre written in Nynorsk consists of a wealth of plays, novels, poetry collections,
        essays, children’s books and translations. In his radical reduction of language and dramatic action, he
        expresses the most powerful human emotions of anxiety and powerlessness in the simplest everyday terms. It is
        through this ability to evoke man’s loss of orientation, that he is a major innovator in contemporary theatre.
        Despite Fosse's negative outlook, there is great warmth and humour in his work, and a naïve vulnerability to
        his stark images of human experience.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Nobel Prize in Literature 2022 was awarded to Annie Ernaux "for the courage and clinical acuity with which
        she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory"
      </p>
      <h2>Work </h2>
      <p>
        In her writing, Annie Ernaux consistently and from different angles, examines a life marked by strong
        disparities regarding gender, language and class. Her path to authorship was long and arduous. Among her
        novels are ‘A Man's Place’, ‘A Woman's Story’ and ‘Years’. Ernaux's work is uncompromising and written in
        plain language, scraped clean. And when she with great courage and clinical acuity reveals the agony of the
        experience of class, describing shame, humiliation, jealousy or inability to see who you are, she has achieved
        something admirable and enduring.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Nobel Prize in Literature 2021 was awarded to Abdulrazak Gurnah "for his uncompromising and compassionate
        penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and
        continents"
      </p>
      <h2>Work </h2>
      <p>
        The theme of the refugee’s disruption runs throughout Abdulrazak Gurnah's work. He grew up on the island of
        Zanzibar, but in the 1960s oppression and persecution of citizens of Arab origin forced him to leave the
        country. Eventually he settled in England. His novels depict a culturally diversified East Africa. Gurnah’s
        dedication to truth and his aversion to simplification are striking. This can make him bleak and
        uncompromising, at the same time as he follows the fates of individuals with great compassion and unbending
        commitment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Nobel Prize in Literature 2020 was awarded to Louise Glück "for her unmistakable poetic voice that with
        austere beauty makes individual existence universal"
      </p>
      <h2>Work </h2>
      <p>
        Personal experiences have always been an important touchstone for Louise Glück’s poetry. Childhood, family
        life, relationships and death are recurring themes in her collections. Glück seeks out the universal. Myths
        and classical motifs are found in most of her work. In addition to classical mythology, the rich
        English-language poetry tradition is her primary literary source of inspiration. Glück’s language is
        characterised by clarity and precision and is free of poetic formalities; she often uses daily spoken
        language.
