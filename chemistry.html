      The Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded 117 times to 200 Nobel Prize laureates between 1901 and 2025.
      Frederick Sanger and Barry Sharpless have both been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice. This means that a
      total of 198 individuals have received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Click on the links to get more information.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2024 was divided, one half awarded to David Baker "for computational protein
          design", the other half jointly to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper "for protein structure prediction"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Proteins control and drive all the chemical reactions that together are the basis of life. Proteins generally
          consist of 20 different amino acids, which can be described as life’s building blocks. In 2003, David Baker
          succeeded in using these blocks to design a new protein that was unlike any other protein. Baker used
          computer-based methods, which he had developed. This created opportunities to develop an enormous diversity of
          new proteins. New proteins can be used in, for example, drugs, vaccines and materials and sensors.

          The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023 was awarded to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Aleksey Yekimov "for the

        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          When grains of matter become very small – when they shrink to nano-dimensions – quantum phenomena arise. Such
          specified sizes and with smooth surfaces which was necessary for them to be used in applications. As the
          method was easy to use it became revolutionary. Quantum dots are used in electronics, including computer and
          television screens as well as LED lamps. They can also be used to map biological tissue.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2022 was awarded jointly to Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry
          Sharpless "for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Chemists strive to build increasingly complicated molecules. For a long time, this has been very time
          consuming and expensive. Click chemistry means that molecular building blocks snap together quickly and
          efficiently. Around 2000, Carolyn Bertozzi started utilising click chemistry in living organisms. She
          developed bioorthogonal reactions which take place inside living organisms without disrupting the normal
          chemistry of the cell. These reactions are now used to explore cells, track biological processes, and improve
          the targeting of cancer pharmaceuticals.

        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 was awarded jointly to Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan "for the
          development of asymmetric organocatalysis"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Catalysts, substances that accelerate chemical reactions, without becoming part of the final product, are
          important for chemists' ability to construct molecules. In 2000, Benjamin List and David MacMillan,
          independent of each other, developed a new type of catalysis that builds upon small organic molecules. An
          important capacity of many such catalysts is the ability to build only one of two mirror image variants of a
          molecule. Such catalysts are used for example in pharmaceutical research and have made chemistry more
          environmentally friendly.

        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020 was awarded jointly to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna "for
          the development of a method for genome editing"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          The life processes of organisms are controlled by genes made up of sections of DNA. In 2012, Emmanuelle
          Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna developed a method for high-precision genome editing. They used the immune
          system of a bacterium, which disables viruses by cutting their DNA up with a type of genetic scissors. By
          extracting and simplifying the genetic scissors' molecular components, they made it generally applicable. The
          CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors can lead to new scientific discoveries, better crops and new weapons in the fight
          against cancer and genetic diseases.
