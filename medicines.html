        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2024 was awarded jointly to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun "for the
          discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Our genome can be likened to an instruction manual for all cells in our body. Every cell contains the same set
          of instructions. Yet, different cell types have very distinct characteristics. These differences arise from
          gene regulation, which allows each cell to select only the relevant instructions. In 1993, Victor Ambros and
          Gary Ruvkun discovered microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA molecules that play a crucial role in gene
          regulation. This new dimension to gene regulation is fundamentally important for how organisms develop and
          function.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023 was awarded jointly to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman "for
          their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA
          vaccines against COVID-19"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          A vaccine prevents diseases by stimulating the body's immune system to develop a defense against the
          infectious agent. One type of vaccine uses mRNA, which transfers genetic information from DNA to stimulate
          protein production. In 2005, Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó discovered that certain modifications of the
          building blocks of RNA prevented unwanted inflammatory reactions and increased the production of desired
          proteins. The discovery laid the foundation for effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic
          that began in early 2020.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2022 was awarded to Svante Pääbo "for his discoveries concerning the
          genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution"
      </p>
      <h2>Work </h2>
      <p>
         Where do we humans come from, and how are we related to extinct hominins? In 2010, Svante Pääbo succeeded in
          sequencing the genome of the Neanderthal. He also discovered a previously unknown hominin, Denisova. He also
          found that gene transfer had occurred from these now extinct hominins to Homo sapiens following the migration
          out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological
          relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2021 was awarded jointly to David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian "for
          their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Our ability to sense heat, cold and touch is essential for survival and underpins our interaction with the
          world around us. In the late 1990s, David Julius investigated how temperature is translated into nerve
          impulses. He utilized capsaicin, a compound from chili peppers that induces a burning sensation, and DNA
          fragments, genes, which are active in heat-sensing neurons. One single gene was able to make cells capsaicin
          sensitive. Further experiments revealed that the gene encoded a heat-sensing receptor on the neurons.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2020 was awarded jointly to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and
          Charles M. Rice "for the discovery of Hepatitis C virus"
        </p>
        <h2>Work </h2>
        <p>
          Hepatitis is a group of diseases that cause inflammation of the liver. It can be caused by different viruses
          that are transmitted through blood. After Harvey Alter had demonstrated that a previously unknown virus
          transmitted the disease, Michael Houghton and his colleagues were able to isolate the virus’s genome in 1989.
          The virus turned out to be an RNA virus from the Flavivirus family and was given the name the hepatitis C
          virus. The finding was an important step in developing blood tests and new medications that have saved
          millions of lives.
