        <h2>The 2025 Physics Laureates</h2>
        <p>
          The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 to
          <span class="highlight">John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis</span> <b>“for the discovery of
            macroscopic
            quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit.”</b> <br><br>
          Their experiments demonstrated that the bizarre properties of quantum mechanics can exist in
          macroscopic systems—leading to breakthroughs in superconducting quantum technology.

        <h2>Their experiments on a chip revealed quantum physics in action</h2>
        <p>
          A major question in physics is the maximum size of a system that can demonstrate quantum mechanical effects.
          This year’s <span class="highlight">Nobel Prize</span> laureates conducted experiments with an electrical
          circuit demonstrating both
          quantum mechanical tunnelling and quantised energy levels in a system big enough to be held in the hand.
          <br><br>
          These experiments have opened doors to the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum
          cryptography,
          quantum computers, and quantum sensors.

          The Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry 2025 have created molecular constructions with large spaces
          through which gases and other chemicals can flow. These metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used
          to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases, or catalyse reactions. <br><br>
          Their discovery has provided chemists with innovative tools to address global environmental challenges.

          <span class="highlight">Maria Corina Machado</span> has led the struggle for <b>democracy</b> in the face of ever-expanding authoritarianism in
          Venezuela. Ms Machado studied engineering and finance, and had a short career in business. In 1992 she
          established the <b>Atenea Foundation</b>, which works to benefit street children in Caracas.Ms Machado is receiving
          the Nobel Peace Prize first and foremost for her efforts to advance democracy in Venezuela. But democracy is
          also in retreat internationally. Democracy – understood as the right to freely express one’s opinion, to cast
          one’s vote and to be represented in elective government – is the foundation of peace both within countries and
          between countries.

        <h2>“It was a choice of ballots over bullets”</h2>
        <p>
          The Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 goes to a brave and committed champion of peace – to a woman who keeps the
          flame of democracy burning amid a growing darkness. As the leader of the democracy movement in Venezuela,
          <span class="highlight">Maria Corina Machado</span> is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent
          times.

          Ms Machado has been a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided – an
          opposition that found common ground in the demand for free elections and representative government.

        <h2>They show how new technology can drive sustained growth</h2>
        <p>
          Over the last two centuries, for the first time in history, the world has seen sustained economic growth. This
          has lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty and laid the foundation of our prosperity. This year’s
          laureates in economic sciences, <b>Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt,</b> explain how innovation provides
          the impetus for further progress.

          The laureates have taught us that sustained growth cannot be taken for granted. Economic stagnation, not
          growth, has been the norm for most of human history. Their work shows that we must be aware of, and
          counteract, threats to continued growth.
